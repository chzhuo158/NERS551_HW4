# NERS551_HW4

# Question A
```
python ./direct.py
```
solve the PKE analytically. The output is PEK_sol_dir.out.

# Question B
```
python ./solvePKE.py
``` 
solve the PKE with one group delay neutron, the output is in PKE_sol.out.

```
python ./plotPKE.py
```
draw the rho, p and zeta, the figures are not shown automatically but saved into "./figure" folder.

```
python ./validatePKE.py
```
compare the numerical results with the analytical results, the figure is saved into "./figure" foler.

# Question C 
```
python ./solvePKE_six.py
```
solve the PKE with six group delay netron, the output is PKE_sol_six.out.
